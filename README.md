# Hashing_with_chains
In this problem you will implement a hash table using the chaining scheme. Chaining is one of the most popular ways of implementing hash tables in practice. The hash table you will implement can be used to implement a phone book on your phone or to store the password table of your computer or web service (but donâ€™t forget to store hashes of passwords instead of the passwords themselves, or you will get hacked!).
